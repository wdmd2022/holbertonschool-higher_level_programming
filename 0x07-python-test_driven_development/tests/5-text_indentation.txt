The ``text_indentation`` module
==========================

Using ``text_indentation``
---------------------

This is an example test file in text format. First import
``text_indentation`` from the ``text_indentation`` module:

    >>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation

Let's start off easy and give it a nice string with no breaks:
    >>> text_indentation("Cool string, friend")
    Cool string, friend>>>

That was terrific! Let's give it a non-string argument:
    >>> text_indentation(4)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

Okay, now let's give it no argument:
    >>> text_indentation()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TTypeError: text_indentation() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'

And now let's try a string with lots of breaks:
    >>> text_indentation("Wow. Cool function. I love your code. You?")
    Wow.

    Cool function.

    I love your code.

    You?>>>

Let's try just punctuation marks:
    >>> text_indentation("::")
    :

    :

And let's give it too many arguments:
    >>> text_indentation("hey:", "you")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text_indentation() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
