The ``say_my_name`` module
==========================

Using ``say_my_name``
---------------------

This is an example test file in text format. First import
``say_my_name`` from the ``say_my_name`` module:

    >>> say_my_name = __import__("3-say_my_name").say_my_name

Let's start off easy and give it a great first name only:
    >>> say_my_name("SwizzleBert")
    My name is SwizzleBert

Let's start off easy and give it a great first and last name:
    >>> say_my_name("SwizzleBert", "Jones")
    My name is SwizzleBert Jones

Now let's kick it up a notch and feed it an integer
    >>> numbername = 999.5
    >>> say_my_name(numbername)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: first_name must be a string

Now let's kick it up a second notch and give it a number + good last name
    >>> numbername = 999.5
    >>> say_my_name(numbername, "Fizzleton")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: first_name must be a string

Let's up the intensity with two integers now:
    >>> ll = 50
    >>> coolj = 1234.5
    >>> say_my_name(ll, coolj)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: first_name must be a string

And now a great first name and non-string last name:
    >>> say_my_name("Tony", 55)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: last_name must be a string
